        <p>
         Hello! I'm Seve (seh-vee) Nerowski (ner-ow-ski). I am brand new to web development, and this is my portfolio. I will be working every single day over the next three months (the date is currently the 19th of December, year of our lord 2022) to grow my portfolio.<br>
         As of today, me and my classmates have gone through HTML, CSS, advanced CSS, and the very beginnings of JavaScript. Although everything does not make complete sense to me yet, I will do everything I can to work, study, and get better at this.<br>
         <br><br>
         Since I do not have a whole lot to share as of right now in terms of my work, I suppose that I'll just have to place some fun facts here until I can come back and put info in here that would actually matter to a potential employer.<br>
         I have been married for two years, and we have a dog named Bella. My favorite movie of all time is <span>The Big Lebowski</span>. My wife and I have traveled to several countries including: Japan, Italy, and France. I have always had an interest in the tech sector,<br>
         and I even did all of the prework for a different full-stack bootcamp around five years ago, but I didn't have the money at the time to go forward with it. I am extremely excited to learn, and become (hopefully) a solid developer.
        </p>
